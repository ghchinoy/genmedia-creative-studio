# Multi-environment configuration (`environments/`)

This directory holds one `*.tfvars` file per deployment environment plus this
guide. It supports running the **same** root Terraform configuration against
**more than one environment** (non-prod and prod) without duplicating the config
and without Terraform workspaces.

It does **not** change how a default `terraform apply` behaves: these files are
inert unless you pass one explicitly with `-var-file`. The existing hand-written
`terraform.tfvars` flow documented in `deploy.md` still works unchanged.

## Model: separate GCP project per environment

Environment isolation is achieved by **using a separate GCP project per
environment** (the design default — see `design.md` §3.6.1). This works because:

- `project_id` is already an input variable, so each environment simply targets
  a different project.
- Every project-scoped resource name (the Cloud Run service `creative-studio`,
  the Firestore database `create-studio-asset-metadata`, the Artifact Registry
  repo `creative-studio`, the runtime/build service accounts) is unique **within**
  its project and therefore cannot collide across projects.
- Both GCS buckets are derived from `project_id`
  (`creative-studio-<project_id>-assets` and
  `run-resources-<project_id>-<region>`), so even though GCS bucket names are a
  **global** namespace, two environments in two projects get distinct, non-
  colliding bucket names automatically. **No resource name is env-suffixed.**

Because names do not change between environments, moving to multi-env introduces
**no resource-address changes and no `moved {}` blocks**, and prod behavior is
unchanged **by the multi-environment mechanism itself**. That statement is about
this directory's per-environment variable selection only — it is not a claim that
prod is unaffected by every change that uses it. For the prod identity change in
the current phase, see the Vuln #4 section below.

## Per-environment workflow

Each environment has **isolated Terraform state**: a distinct backend `prefix`
(and normally a distinct state bucket, since each project has its own). Run these
from the Cloud Run root directory `deploy/terraform/cloudrun` (the tfvars files in
this directory are referenced as `../environments/<env>.tfvars`). Select an
environment at `init` time (backend prefix) and at `plan`/`apply` time (tfvars):

```bash
# Run from deploy/terraform/cloudrun (this file lives at ../environments/).
cd deploy/terraform/cloudrun

# 1. Point Terraform at this environment's state (backend is not in *.tfvars).
#    -reconfigure is REQUIRED when switching environments so Terraform adopts the
#    new backend settings instead of reusing the previously-initialized backend.
terraform init -reconfigure \
  -backend-config="bucket=<STATE_BUCKET_FOR_ENV>" \
  -backend-config="prefix=creative-studio/<env>"

# 2. Plan / apply with this environment's variable file.
terraform plan  -var-file=../environments/<env>.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=../environments/<env>.tfvars
```

Where `<env>` is `prod` or `nonprod` (staging). Examples:

| Environment | tfvars (from `cloudrun/`) | Backend prefix | State bucket (example) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| prod | `../environments/prod.tfvars` | `creative-studio/prod` | `<PROD_TF_STATE_BUCKET>` |
| non-prod | `../environments/nonprod.tfvars` | `creative-studio/staging` | `gs://<NONPROD_TF_STATE_BUCKET>` |

The `creative-studio/prod` prefix matches the value committed in `backend.tf`;
`creative-studio/staging` matches the proven staging stand-up
(`staging-standup-report.md`).

## The isolated-state boundary (why `-reconfigure`)

Each `(environment)` pair maps to exactly one state object:
`gs://<state-bucket>/<prefix>/default.tfstate`. That object is the blast-radius
boundary — an apply against one environment can never read or mutate another
environment's resources, because it is a different state in a different project.

Terraform caches the backend it was last initialized with in `.terraform/`. When
you switch from one environment to another you **must** re-run
`terraform init -reconfigure` with the new `-backend-config` so it does not keep
operating against the previous environment's state object. Skipping
`-reconfigure` is the classic "applied to the wrong environment" foot-gun; the
explicit prefix + `-var-file` per environment (instead of Terraform workspaces)
keeps "which environment am I about to touch" visible on every command.

## Vuln #4: verified-identity env contract & apply ordering

**Both Cloud Run environments** — nonprod/staging and prod — set the same three
verified-identity env vars on the Cloud Run service (`APP_ENV`,
`REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_USER`, `IAP_JWT_AUDIENCE`), and in both `APP_ENV` resolves
to a non-local value so the app derives `AUTH_MODE='iap'`.
They differ only in the **form of the audience**, because they differ in topology.
They remain separate applies against separate state, so each environment is rolled
independently and on its own schedule:

| Path | Audience form | Fail-closed guard | Rolled by |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| nonprod (`use_lb = false`), native Cloud Run | `/projects/<number>/locations/<region>/services/creative-studio` | `terraform_data.nonprod_app_env_guard` | a separate nonprod/staging apply |
| prod (`use_lb = true`), behind the LB | `/projects/<number>/global/backendServices/<generated_id>` | `terraform_data.prod_app_env_guard` | **this phase** — see below |

**Scope: "both environments" means the two Cloud Run environments above.** The GKE
deploy root (`deploy/terraform/gke/`) is **out of this contract**: it sets none of
the three identity env vars and has no `*_app_env_guard`, and nothing in this
directory changes that. Extending the contract to the GKE root is a separate
change.

### Contract rules (both paths)

- **Terraform does NOT set the container image — image and env are NOT
  co-deployed atomically.** In `iap` mode the app FATALs at boot if
  `IAP_JWT_AUDIENCE` is unset, and once `REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_USER=true` the
  service rejects any request without a verified identity — so these env vars are
  only meaningful on a revision that is running the merged verified-identity app
  image. Terraform cannot pair them for you: the Cloud Run resource carries
  `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [template[0].containers[0].image, ...] }`
  (`modules/cloud-run-service/main.tf:131-133`), so on an **existing** service an
  apply never changes the image and `var.initial_container_image` is inert on that
  path. The image is delivered separately, by `deploy/scripts/deploy.sh` / CD.
  An apply therefore adds the three env vars to a **new revision running
  whatever image is currently deployed**.
- **Confirm the image separately (REQUIRED).** Because the apply does not carry
  the image, the operator MUST separately confirm that the running revision serves
  the intended merged verified-identity build — pin the expected build's image
  **digest** and check the running revision against it. Until that check passes,
  the env vars being correct does **not** mean the service is remediated.
- **Fail-closed guard.** A `terraform_data.<path>_app_env_guard` precondition
  fails the plan/apply if `APP_ENV` resolves to a local-mode value (`""`, `dev`,
  `development`, `local`, `test`), preventing a silent fail-open (mock identity)
  misconfiguration. Each guard is count-gated to its own path, so the nonprod
  guard is inert on prod and vice versa.
- **Post-apply checks (owner-run, do NOT run from CI/agents).** After the apply,
  confirm: (1) a request to the service's entry point (the Cloud Run URL on
  nonprod, the LB domain on prod) lacking a valid `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` is
  rejected (not served an authenticated page); (2) the running revision resolves
  `APP_ENV` to the non-local value (so `AUTH_MODE='iap'`) and has a non-empty
  `IAP_JWT_AUDIENCE`. **Neither check distinguishes a remediated service from a
  still-vulnerable one:** both also pass on a revision whose env vars are correct
  but whose image predates the verified-identity fix — check (1) because the older
  code also rejects a request carrying no identity header, and check (2) because it
  inspects env vars only, never the image. The discriminating checks (the running
  revision's image digest pinned to the merged build, plus a negative test that a
  **spoofed plaintext identity header** is rejected) belong to the Phase-5 rollout
  runbooks and are not reproduced here.

### nonprod (`use_lb = false`) — native Cloud Run audience

The nonprod path sets the three env vars with `APP_ENV` resolving to the `staging`
label, and `IAP_JWT_AUDIENCE` as the native Cloud Run audience built from the
project **number**, region, and the static service name `creative-studio` (never a
hardcoded literal). The guard on this path is
`terraform_data.nonprod_app_env_guard`.

### prod (`use_lb = true`) — LB backend-service audience: **this phase changes prod**

An earlier phase of this rollout described the prod IAP audience as "a separate
two-stage change held for a later phase", and prod's rendered env map as unchanged.
**That later phase is this change.** The prod path now merges the same three
identity env vars into the prod Cloud Run service, using the LB backend-service
audience form.

**Blast radius: applying this to prod rolls a NEW prod revision.** The prod service
spec is *not* byte-for-byte unchanged. What to expect and watch:

- **In the plan:** an **in-place update** of the `google_cloud_run_v2_service`
  adding the three env vars — not a replacement — and **no** change to the LB, the
  serverless NEG or the backend service. Anything else, stop and re-check the
  tfvars and backend prefix.
- **`IAP_JWT_AUDIENCE` must render non-empty** in the plan, as
  `/projects/<number>/global/backendServices/<numeric id>`. An empty or
  partially-rendered audience means the data source below did not resolve — stop,
  do not apply.
- **At apply:** a new revision is created and traffic migrates to it. Once it
  serves, `REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATED_USER=true` is live in prod and any request the app
  cannot attach a verified IAP identity to is rejected. Verify real user access
  through the LB domain promptly after traffic shifts.
- **Rollback is forward, not in-place.** There is no undo of a revision through
  this configuration: reverting means `terraform apply` of the previous config,
  which rolls a *further* new revision. A manual Cloud Run traffic split back to
  the prior revision will be reverted by the next apply, so treat it as an
  emergency stop-gap only and reconcile the config afterwards.

#### PRECONDITION — green-field / DR: check BEFORE the prod plan

The prod audience is derived by reading the **already-existing** prod backend
service `creativestudio-backend-default` through a `google_compute_backend_service`
data source, resolved at **plan** time. This path is therefore an **in-place
rollout only**; it does not bootstrap a prod that does not yet exist.

- *What to check:* the backend service exists in the target prod project before you
  plan —
  ```bash
  gcloud compute backend-services describe creativestudio-backend-default \
    --global --project <PROD_PROJECT_ID>
  ```
  This should return the resource; its `id` is the numeric id that goes into the
  audience.
- *If it is not met* — a fresh prod project, or a disaster-recovery rebuild —
  `terraform plan` **fails with a 404 on that data source**. That is expected
  behaviour, not a bug in the configuration.
- *What to do:* do **not** work around it by hardcoding a number or id into the
  audience; a wrong audience means every request 401s, with no plan-time failure to
  warn you. Green-field bootstrap is a separate two-phase concern: stand up the LB,
  the serverless NEG and the backend service first, then re-run this apply so the
  data source resolves against the real backend service. If you hit this during a
  DR restore, raise it rather than improvising the audience.

The same limitation is recorded in an inline comment on the data source in
`cloudrun/main.tf`; this section is the operator-facing statement of it.

## Notes

- **Backend config is never stored in these tfvars files.** The state bucket and
  prefix are supplied at `init` (see `backend.tf`), keeping project-specific state
  locations out of version control.
- **No secrets live here.** The configuration currently has none; the Phase 4
  Secret Manager inputs (`secret_ids`, `secret_env`) stay empty/dormant.
- For the full end-to-end deploy story (Cloud Build image build via `build.sh`,
  DNS A record for the LB, IAP user grants), see `deploy.md`. This directory only
  adds the per-environment variable selection on top of that existing flow.
- A future layered state split / GKE fan-out (design.md §3.5, §3.6.2, Phase 8+)
  would extend the prefix to `creative-studio/<env>/<layer>`; today there is a
  single root, so the prefix is `creative-studio/<env>`.
